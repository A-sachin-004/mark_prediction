# Student Grade Prediction
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' grades in university exams based on their historical internal exam marks. The predictive model employs machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing random forest models. Additionally, the project provides insights into pass/fail counts based on subjects, gender, and hostel type, visualized through bar graphs using Matplotlib.
# Requirements
Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
 <br> pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
# Usage
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/A-sachin-004/mark_prediction.git<br>
cd mark_prediction<br>
2.To Run Code:<br>
python markprediction.py<br>
3.View the predicted marks and generated bar graphs for pass/fail counts.<br>
