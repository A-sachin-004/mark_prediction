# Student Grade Prediction
This project focuses on predicting students' grades in university exams based on their historical internal exam marks. The predictive model employs machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing random forest models. Additionally, the project provides insights into pass/fail counts based on subjects, gender, and hostel type, visualized through bar graphs using Matplotlib.

# Objective:
The primary objective is to predict the marks of students for various subjects based on the marks they have scored in previous exams.


## Requirements
Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```
## Installation & Usage

1.Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-sachin-004/mark_prediction.git
cd mark_prediction
```
2.To Run Code:
```bash
python markprediction.py
```
3.View the predicted marks and generated bar graphs for pass/fail counts.
